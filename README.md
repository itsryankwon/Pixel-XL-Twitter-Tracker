# Pixel-XL-Twitter-Tracker
Pixel XL Twitter Tracker

Using BeautifulSoup to scrape and Tweepy to utilize Twitter's API, this Python program scrapes
Google's Pixel website and sees what the current inventory status is on all models of the Pixel
XL model phones(not regular Pixels but that can easily be added by following the included functions)
and posts the status of all phones to a Twitter account(I've made @pixelxlstock to demonstrate). If
a phone is in stock, it will send a direct message to a specified user(in this example code, it will
send a direct message to my personal twitter account @itsryankwon when a 128GB Silver model, 128GB Black
model, or Blue model is in stock).
